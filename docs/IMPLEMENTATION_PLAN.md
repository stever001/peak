# Implementation Plan

A phased plan that goes from today's scaffolding to a working internal operating
system, without overbuilding. Each phase is shippable and de-risks the next.

**Guiding rule:** prove the workflow with the lightest possible machinery before
adding structure, storage, or automation.

---

## Phase 0 — Scaffolding *(this phase)*

**Goal:** a clean, understandable repository that defines the operating model,
workflows, data objects, and plan.

- [x] Repository structure (`agents/`, `schemas/`, `examples/`, `prompts/`, `tests/`).
- [x] `README.md` — purpose, internal-vs-client-facing distinction, first workflow.
- [x] `docs/OPERATING_MODEL.md`
- [x] `docs/AGENT_WORKFLOWS.md`
- [x] `docs/DATA_OBJECTS.md`
- [x] `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`

**Exit criteria:** a developer, consultant, and investor can each read the repo and
understand what Peak is building and why. No agent logic yet.

---

## Phase 1 — Data object schemas & examples

**Goal:** turn the candidate data objects into concrete, portable schemas with
worked examples.

- [x] Define schemas under `schemas/` (portable, serialization-neutral JSON Schema
  draft 2020-12, no vendor lock-in).
- [x] First-thread objects defined: `ClientIntake`, `EvidenceReference`,
  `StakeholderInterview`, `VisualObservation`, `WorkflowObservation`,
  `InventorySystemProfile`.
- [x] Anonymized worked examples added under `examples/` (one coherent engagement).
- [x] Validation harness added under `tests/` (`validate_phase1.py`): schema
  self-check, example conformance, and referential lint. Dev dependency pinned in
  `requirements-dev.txt`.

**Exit criteria:** every first-thread object has a schema, at least one example, and
a passing validation test. Still no live agents. — **Met.** Run `make validate`
(or `python3 tests/validate_phase1.py`); exits 0 on pass, and unresolved
cross-references are non-blocking warnings in Phase 1.

---

## Phase 2 — First workflow, human-in-the-loop

**Goal:** prove the end-to-end thread with agent-assisted drafting, run manually.

**Groundwork done — the operating unit:**

- [x] `EngagementPacket` schema ([`schemas/engagement-packet.schema.json`](../schemas/engagement-packet.schema.json))
  and worked example: one self-contained bundle of an engagement's first-thread
  assessment (intake, system profile, evidence, interviews, observations), composing
  the Phase 1 objects by local relative `$ref`. This is the practical unit future
  agents will read from and write to.
- [x] Packet-level validation ([`tests/validate_phase2.py`](../tests/validate_phase2.py)):
  offline `$ref` resolution, packet conformance, and **blocking** referential
  integrity (evidence resolves within the packet; nested `related_intake_id`s match
  the packet's intake). Run via `make validate`.

No agent logic yet — the packet is the data contract that agent work will build on.

**Prompt contracts done — the operating instructions:**

- [x] Reusable **prompt contracts** in [`../prompts/`](../prompts/) for the whole
  first thread — intake, discovery planning, evidence findings, initial report,
  next-phase proposal, QA review, and engagement lessons. Each is a markdown contract
  (purpose, inputs, grounding/evidence rules, non-goals, output format, quality
  checks, reusable body) that a consultant copies into an LLM. Most operate on an
  `EngagementPacket` and require citing packet `evid_` ids.
- [x] Prompt-inventory check ([`tests/validate_phase3_prompts.py`](../tests/validate_phase3_prompts.py),
  stdlib-only) wired into `make validate`.

These are **human-run prompt contracts, not autonomous agents**, and are internal-only.

**Worked example run — the contracts demonstrated end-to-end:**

- [x] Sample run artifacts in [`../examples/outputs/`](../examples/outputs/): a
  discovery plan, evidence findings, initial assessment report, next-phase proposal,
  QA review, and engagement lessons, all produced from
  `examples/engagement-packet.example.json`. These show what each contract yields on
  one coherent engagement, with evidence cited and the observed/claim/interpretation/
  follow-up separation preserved. **Illustrative human-reviewable examples — not
  automation output.**
- [x] Presence/heading check ([`../tests/validate_phase4_outputs.py`](../tests/validate_phase4_outputs.py),
  stdlib-only) wired into `make validate`. Structural only — no quality judgement.

**Local runner — human-in-the-loop helper:**

- [x] [`../tools/packet_runner.py`](../tools/packet_runner.py) (`make packet-summary`):
  a read-only helper that summarizes an `EngagementPacket` and points a consultant at
  the right prompt contract and output target. Makes **no** LLM/API/database/AgentNet/
  network call — deliberately not an agent runtime. Smoke-tested by
  [`../tests/validate_phase5_runner.py`](../tests/validate_phase5_runner.py) in
  `make validate`.

**Still to do:**

- Implement lightweight agents in `agents/intake/`, `agents/discovery/`,
  `agents/evidence/`, `agents/reporting/`, `agents/proposal/` that take structured
  input and produce structured output conforming to the schemas (the prompt contracts
  above are the specification for that behavior, and the sample outputs are a target
  for what "good" looks like). The runner is the manual precursor: it orients the
  consultant without automating the LLM step.
- Keep everything file-based and consultant-run; **no database, no frontend.**
- Enforce evidence-first: agent outputs must cite `EvidenceReference`s.

**Exit criteria:** a consultant can run one real (anonymized) engagement through the
thread end-to-end and get a reviewable draft report and proposal.

---

## Phase 3 — QA / governance and learning capture

**Goal:** close the loop with quality gating and reusable knowledge.

**Prompt contracts done (groundwork):**

- [x] `prompts/qa/review-assessment-packet.prompt.md` — strict QA of a packet and any
  draft report/proposal (unsupported claims, missing evidence, contradictions,
  readiness score, required fixes).
- [x] `prompts/learning/extract-engagement-lessons.prompt.md` — reusable lessons and
  **draft** candidate knowledge capsules (explicitly not yet grounded/published to
  AgentNet).

**Still to do:**

- Implement `agents/qa/`: checks for evidence traceability, consistency, and
  completeness; produces QA findings and a sign-off record.
- Implement `agents/learning/`: capture reusable knowledge from each engagement.
- Define how learning entries feed back into future runs.

**Exit criteria:** no client-facing artifact is produced without a QA record, and
each engagement yields at least one reusable knowledge entry.

---

## Phase 4 — AgentNet grounding integration

**Goal:** move AgentNet from *intended architecture* to *live grounding*.

- Integrate AgentNet as the grounding/resolution layer for agent outputs.
- Reconcile outputs against Peak methodology and prior engagements.
- Update docs to reflect what is genuinely live (and only what is live).

**Exit criteria:** agent outputs are demonstrably grounded/resolved via AgentNet,
and documentation accurately states integration status.

> Until this phase is complete, no file may claim AgentNet integration is done.

---

## Phase 5 — Hardening & scale (internal)

**Goal:** make the internal system robust enough for routine use across consultants.

- Persistence model and data retention/privacy strategy (prerequisite for storing
  real client data).
- Access control appropriate to client confidentiality.
- Observability: what each agent produced, from what evidence, reviewed by whom.
- Broaden coverage across all ten workflows.

**Exit criteria:** multiple consultants run real engagements on the system with
governed, auditable output.

---

## Explicitly out of scope (for now)

Deferred until the internal core is proven:

- **Client-facing frontend / portal.**
- **Database / persistence layer** (Phase 5 prerequisite before real client data).
- **Automated client deliverables** without consultant review.
- **Vendor-specific lock-in** — keep schemas, prompts, and interfaces portable.

## Dependencies & sequencing

```
Phase 0 (scaffold) → Phase 1 (schemas) → Phase 2 (first workflow)
                                              ↓
                              Phase 3 (QA + learning)
                                              ↓
                              Phase 4 (AgentNet grounding)
                                              ↓
                              Phase 5 (hardening & scale)
```

Each phase depends on the one before it. Do not start client-facing work until the
internal operating system is proven through at least Phase 3.
